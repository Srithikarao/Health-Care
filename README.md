#  Healthcare Data Analysis in Excel (2019–2024) Using Excel

This project analyzes a real-world healthcare dataset to uncover key insights about patient admissions, medical conditions, billing, and hospital performance - all using Microsoft Excel.

##  Project Overview

Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, I cleaned, transformed, and analyzed over 55,500 patient records from 2019 to 2024. I created an interactive Excel dashboard that allows users to explore trends by age group, gender, admission type, hospital, and more.

##  Key Features

-  Data Cleaning and Standardization (Names, Dates, Case Formatting)
-  Derived Columns: Age Group, Length of Stay
-  Pivot Table Analysis by:
  - Medical Condition
  - Admission Type
  - Yearly Trends (2019 vs 2024)
  - Hospital-wise patient volumes
-  Conditional Formatting for Heatmaps
-  Slicers for dynamic filtering (Gender, Admission Type, Hospital)
-  KPIs:
  - Total Admissions
  - Average Billing Amount
  - Top 3 Medical Conditions
  - Calendar Heatmap (Month × Day of Week)

##  Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (ETL,Power Query editor,Pivot Tables,Data Modeling, Slicers, Charts, Conditional Formatting)
- Dataset: [Kaggle - Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset)

##  Files Included

- `healthcare_dataset.csv` – Original dataset from Kaggle
